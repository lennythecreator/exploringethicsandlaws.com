            <p class="p-3">Over the last decade, artificial intelligence has undergone transformative advancements,
                changing the way we perceive and interact with technology. While the roots of artificial
                intelligence were sown in the early 1900s, in the 1950s was where significant strides were taken.
                However, over the last 10 years, we have witnessed an unprecedented rise in the development of
                AI from machine learning algorithms enabling personalized recommendations to the
                proliferation of natural language processing facilitating human-computer interaction. This
                journey from conceptual foundations to tangible progress, underscores the trajectory of AI,
                setting the stage for further exploration and refinement in the years to come. 
            </p>

            <p class="p-3">Siri, the virtual assistant that has become an integral part of Apple&#39;s ecosystem, emerged from
                the collaborative efforts of a startup company and its innovative founders. Siri Inc. was
                established in 2007 by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Tom Gruber, envisioning a
                revolutionary voice-controlled interface. Apple recognized the potential of Siri and its advanced
                capabilities, leading to its acquisition by the tech giant in 2010. Subsequently, Siri made its debut
                on the iPhone 4S in 2011, marking a significant leap in the realm of voice-activated personal
                assistants and paving the way for the integration of similar technologies across various devices.
                Apple&#39;s Siri faced privacy concerns that gained prominence around 2019 when reports
                emerged about the inadvertent collection of user audio recordings. It was revealed that
                contractors hired by Apple to enhance Siri&#39;s performance had access to snippets of users&#39;
                conversations. </p>

            <p class="p-3">This sparked a debate about the balance between improving voice recognition
                technology and safeguarding user privacy. In response to the outcry, Apple took swift measures
                to address the issue. They temporarily suspended the grading program, allowing users to opt-in
                
                or opt-out of audio sample sharing, and introduced more transparent privacy policies. These
                changes aimed to assure users that Apple was committed to protecting their privacy while
                continuing to refine Siri&#39;s capabilities. The incident highlighted the evolving challenges tech
                companies face in balancing innovation with user privacy concerns.</p>

            <header class="text-3xl p-3 font-bold">Understanding User terms and Conditions</header>
            <p class="p-3">When agreeing to a terms & conditions people are not usually aware of what is said
                within the guidelines & don’t know what they are unknowingly agreeing to. Here’s some of
                the information involved in said terms & conditions.
                Companies use code to gather user information like location and data usage said
                information is stated in the privacy policy but users don’t read and they won’t get any type of
                indication about their information being gathered.
                Terms & Conditions have continuously gotten longer over the years, previous versions
                were brief and more quick to the point. Today’s versions consist of multiple pages with
                underlying detail and information users do not know they are actually agreeing to.
                There are user responsibilities installed in terms & conditions that one also agrees to
                including laws that one may unintentionally violate if not careful.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p-3">Transaction Data cannot be deleted even upon request so that companies may comply
                with the law.
                Personal Data can be shared to or accessed by other parts of the world said in the
                agreement part of the privacy policy.
                A user’s personal data can be automatically used when trying to gauge the interest of the
                user itself or possible interest of other users.
                Companies gather an enormous amount of information if they choose to let them acquire
                that information. Users usually do accept said release of information as soon as they open their
                phones not paying attention to what is said and automatically accept the terms & conditions.
            </p>

            <p class="p-3">
                When automatically agreeing to terms and conditions courts will usually side with the
                company involved in any case, due to the fact that assent or agreement from a customer is
                directly from the first approval of a terms and conditions warning. That being said, a person at
                any time accepts a terms & conditions agreement their chances to sue a company and for
                something they didn’t know was said in them would most likely automatically lose said lawsuit.
            </p>

            <p class="p-3">To avoid any confusion companies must create a terms and conditions that is clearly
                noticeable for the user to understand, they usually try not to use a link to tell one to click to read
                on a different page from where the agree button is.
                The text is most of the time before the agree button giving the user a fair chance to
                possibly read before they do agree to anything.

            <p class="p-3">
                Emily Sortor  |  August 9, 2019
                U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White reopens 
                In the case  improperly recording, storing, and sharing private conversations. 
                Apple’s argument: Apple argued that it did not intentionally intercept any conversations. 
                Plaintiff Fumiko Lopez’s: he allegedly received targeted advertisements based on private conversations he had near a Siri device. 
                John Pappas: alleges he received targeted advertisements for pharmaceutical drugs after he talked to his physician in the presence of an Apple Siri device. 

            </p>

            <p class="p-3">
                The ethical concerns surrounding the extensive and intricate terms and conditions, common among tech companies, extend beyond Apple to the broader technology industry. The core of the issue lies in the challenge users face in fully comprehending the suggestion of these agreements, raising questions about the validity of informed consent. The intentional complexity of these documents obscures transparency, making it difficult for users to grasp the extent of data practices employed by the company, thereby compromising the essential principle of trust. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="p-3">
                That being in the event John Pappas did read the terms and conditions prior to receiving targeted advertisements based on a private conversation he had near a Siri device he is unlikely to comprehend the material due to the language being used. This situation exacerbates the power imbalance between users and tech giants, as individuals may feel compelled to agree to terms they don't fully understand. From a legal standpoint, the enforceability of agreements is brought into question, with courts likely to scrutinize contracts that employ intentionally convoluted language. Moreover, the difficult nature of terms and conditions may lead users to unknowingly agree to privacy-invading practices, such as extensive data collection and sharing. Ultimately, these practices undermine user empowerment and necessitate concerted efforts from both regulators and the tech industry to prioritize clarity, simplicity, and transparency in conveying terms and conditions, while also emphasizing user education on the implications of online agreements.
